pick a given place, a location where lots of jobs have been added
run an analysis of what has changed in the commute shed from that area- how many workers are pulled up from other places 
could run a commute time analysis using the mapbox dataset
est time to get to work
the aim of the analysis is just to show "did u know that this many people work in these distance bands?'or something

not only has the quantity of jobs in these neighborhoods changed, so too has the distribution of those jobs

#healthcare employment in north texas is highly concentrated
#healthcar growth is also strongly correlated with employment growth
#existing health care nodes -> expanding
#new health care nodes -> growing
#mix of jobs is generally quite positive in terms of pay
#healthcare areas with most jobs added  (2010-2025)

#take UTSW - the people who work in these critical employment blocks has changed from 2010 to 2025

#the way the workforce looked in 2025 is like this:
#and is this different for young workers? 
#where young workers lived in 2010 vs where young workers live in 2025
#if young workers lived in the same pattern as 2010 there would be workers in these locations:
XXXXX
#but what we see is instead, those workers in these locations:
XXXXX
#these are areas that have seen rapid growth in apartment construction
#in other words, the housing production system is highly tied to the availabiliy and access to employment
#and put yet another way, cities lose out on potential add-on effects from employment zones when their housing stock is inadequate
